      Our brand typeface is DM Sans by Colophon Foundry for Google. This open-sourcetypeface was chosen for its
      combination of smoothness and structure. Its geometric shapes and soft transitions will bring clarity and openness
      to our texts. Also, itâ€™s open availability will let other members of the NuxtJS community incorporate it into
      their work.
