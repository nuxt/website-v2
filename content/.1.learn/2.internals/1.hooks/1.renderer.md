- Source: **[vue-renderer/renderer.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/blob/dev/packages/vue-renderer/src/renderer.js)**

This class is exporting a connect middleware which handles and serves all SSR and asset requests.

## Hooks

We can register hooks on certain life cycle events.

| Hook | Arguments | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `render:before` | (renderer, options) | Before setting up middleware and resources for the Renderer class, useful to overload some methods or options. |
| `render:setupMiddleware` | (app) _connect instance_ | Before Nuxt adds its middleware stack. We can use it to register custom server side middleware. |
| `render:errorMiddleware` | (app) _connect instance_ | Before adding Nuxt error middleware, useful to add your own middleware before using Nuxt's. See the [Sentry module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/sentry-module/blob/v4.0.3/lib/module.js#L151) for more info. |
| `render:resourcesLoaded` | (resources) | Called after resources for renderer are loaded (client manifest, server bundle, etc). |
| `render:done` | (renderer) | SSR Middleware and all resources are ready (Renderer ready) |
| `render:routeContext` | (context.nuxt) | _Every time a route is server-rendered and before `render:route` hook_. Called before serializing Nuxt context into `window.__NUXT__`, useful to add some data that you can fetch on client-side. |
| `render:route` | (url, result, context) | _Every time a route is server-rendered_. Called before sending back the request to the browser. |
| `render:routeDone` | (url, result, context) | _Every time a route is server-rendered_. Called after the response has been sent to the browser. |
