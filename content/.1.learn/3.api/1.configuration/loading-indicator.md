> Show fancy loading indicator while page is loading!

Without Server Side Rendering (when `ssr` option is `false`), there is no content from the server side on the first page load. So, instead of showing a blank page while the page loads, we may show a spinner.

This property can have 3 different types: `string` or `false` or `object`. If a string value is provided it is converted to object style.

Default value is:

```js
loadingIndicator: {
  name: 'circle',
  color: '#3B8070',
  background: 'white'
}
```

## Built-in indicators

These indicators are imported from the awesome [Spinkit](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit) project. You can use its demo page to preview spinners.

- circle
- cube-grid
- fading-circle
- folding-cube
- chasing-dots
- nuxt
- pulse
- rectangle-bounce
- rotating-plane
- three-bounce
- wandering-cubes

Built-in indicators support `color` and `background` options.

## Custom indicators

If you need your own special indicator, a String value or Name key can also be a path to an html template of indicator source code! All of the options are passed to the template, too.

Nuxt's built-in [source code](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/tree/dev/packages/vue-app/template/views/loading) is also available if you need a base!
