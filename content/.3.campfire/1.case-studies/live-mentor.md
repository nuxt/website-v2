### What is Live Mentor ?

Live Mentor is one of the words leading education companies focused on entrepreneurship. We help creators go from the stage of the idea to being able to live from their projects. So basically being profitable. We have been doing online courses for almost 10 years now, we've been trying a lot of different ways to teach online. We have tried what we called CBC cool off based courses, Set up soft courses, courses with only content and eventually we decided four years ago to focus on one-on-one mentoring. So we decided to create this course format based on the duration of three months. During those three months, you are in touch with a mentor and you connect with this mentor in a messaging app and you keep talking to him or her for the three months of the course. So we have trained more than 10,000 people and we are now training 10,000 people per year.

We have students in more than 30 countries. Our platform is combining technology with storytelling teachers and community integration. We mentor in the topics that are the most important for someone who's starting a business, sales, marketing, hiring, financing, business planning, and all the basics that you need when you are creating a company.

We focus on helping you start a business, quit your salary job and be able to live from your own activity. We have students in 30 countries, but all our lessons are in French, so French people leaving abroad. In total we have 100 people working at Live Mentor.

### How did you discover Nuxt?

actually I was just browsing for a good framework to build a new front. I just kind of find Nuxt. When I saw that the creators of Nuxt were French, I said, okay, they are a French company, so let's build our product with this.

### Why did you choose Nuxt as your frontend framework?

We were in this situation where we had to find a new framework, we had to update our technology because we were having an amount of technical depth that was insane. And it was generating a lot of bugs. It was slowing down like crazy the roadmap and the combo.

It was impossible for us to hire new developers because basically they were looking at the code base and they were telling us, this is shit, I don't want to touch that. I don't want to spend one hour working on that tech machine, that you've been like creating this monster. So there was a bit of urgency there.

Debbie. I can imagine nowadays if you're not using a modern framework, like it's hard to employ new people.

### Are you using dynamic or static rendering? Why?

We use dynamic rendering because our pages are not static and we have a lot of content that has to be updated a lot of times, so use SSR to do this because it's not really a static site.

We are focused like crazy on reactivity because all our pedagogical experience, all the learning experiences is based on the the messaging app between the mentor and the students. And so, uh, one year ago before Nuxt we were using another tool, not another framework, but we were using a messaging tool and it was awful. The messages where not showing up instantly on the users screen and we were also losing some messages as well. So we decided to completely rebuild the messaging app and this is the first decision that one of our developers took when he arrived in our tech team. He said "I need to stop this and we need to rebuild our own messaging app and this is where we decided this combo of firebase plus Nuxt was much better.

On the product side, on this, on the experience side, what we are really focused on is reactivity. For instance our users go through a series of exercises and quizzes during the online course, and we need to be able to show the results of those exercises and quizzes on the users side and also on the mentors side.

### What is your favorite feature?

There are many actually. The way the authentication works. There are a lot of things that are improved from just using Vue.js as the framework. The fact that you can easily mix TypeScript and JavaScript. It's a modularity and the fact that the architecture creates everything you need. For pages you don't have to mess with a router. You can just structure your pages how you want in the folder and everything works. It just works.

### Do you have performances benchmarks before & after using Nuxt?

What I can say on my side is that we are hiring front-end developers. And if there is anyone in the Nuxt community that is willing to tackle a new challenge and build the most advanced platform of online education we'll be very happy to talk with him or her.

We are hiring like crazy, like for the last two months, we have been hiring almost every week on the product team. For us receiving an application from someone who is familiar with Nuxt is definitely a big plus.

### Would you recommend Nuxt?

Yes, of course. Because it's really easy to configure. At first there were not so much documentation, but right now you can find everything you need. And the community is active, actually, Sebastian Chopin is really active to our messages and there is a community around it which is going to grow big in the next few years. So of course I would recommend it.
