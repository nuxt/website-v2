## Our Goal

Our mission is to Nuxtify the world and we can't do that without your help. The Nuxt community is extremely important to us and we would love you to be a part of our program to help us share the love and knowledge you have for Nuxt.

## What we look for in an Ambassador

We are looking for people who are not just passionate about Nuxt and using it almost everyday but those who want to help us Nuxtify the world. We all have different skills so perhaps you have already created several amazing blog posts on Nuxt related topics and been featured in the Nuxt Letter or have spoken at conferences with Nuxt related talks or given Nuxt related workshops. Perhaps you have a YouTube Channel with Nuxt Content or have already created Nuxt Courses or Live Streams. We are looking for people who have gone above and beyond in order to share their love for Nuxt with the world and are constantly creating new Nuxt related content in more than one of above mentioned.

## What you gain as an Ambassadors

Ambassadors ar not paid for their work but we do send them some Nuxt swag and we try to support them in their content creation career. We try to push our Ambassadors forward and help them gain access to more speaking opportunities. Being featured on our site gives them a way for people to find them so they can gain more followers or subscribers and reach more people.

Our ambassadors join the Nuxt Team and Maintainers on bi-weekly calls to get product updates and early access to try out new things before they are released. They also get access to the team through our discord channel so they can ask for help and support and feedback or just share things with the team. We try to have one-to-one meetings with the Ambassadors to find our what they need from us and how we can help them Nuxtify the world. 

## Join our mission

To become an ambassador you need to be nominated by one of the Nuxt team or ambassadors. As our program is quite elite we don't accept that many people as we feel we can help people more if we keep the numbers low. For sure in the future our ambassadors of today will probably mentor the ambassadors of tomorrow. We

But for now we would love you to first be a [contributor](/campfire/conributor) for Nuxt and we have a page explaining what you need to do in order to be a Nuxt contributor. And perhaps one day you will make it to the Ambassador program. Good Luck and keep doing awesome stuff with Nuxt.

## Meet our amazing Ambassadors
