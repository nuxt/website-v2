Nuxt.js gives you the possibility to host your web application on any static hosting like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for example.

To deploy on GitHub Pages, you need to generate your static web application:

```bash
npm run generate
```

It will create a `dist` folder with everything inside ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages hosting. Branch `gh-pages` for project repository OR branch `master` for user or organization site

<div class="Alert Alert--nuxt-green">

<b>Info:</b> If you use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages and put `CNAME` file, it is recommended that CNAME file is put in the `static` directory. [More documentation](/docs/directory-structure/static) about it.

</div>

## Deploying to GitHub Pages for repository

First of all, you want to make sure to use [static target](/docs/features/deployment-targets) since we are hosting on GitHub pages:

```js[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  target: 'static'
}
```

If you are creating GitHub Pages for one specific repository, and you don't have any custom domain, the URL of the page will be in this format: `http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

If you deployed `dist` folder without adding [router base](/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-router), when you visit the deployed site you will find that the site is not working due to missing assets. This is because we assume that the website root will be `/`, but in this case it is `/<repository-name>`.

To fix the issue we need to add [router base](/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-router#base) configuration in `nuxt.config.js`:

```js[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  target: 'static',
  router: {
    base: '/<repository-name>/'
  }
}
```

This way, all generated path asset will be prefixed with `/<repository-name>/`, and the next time you deploy the code to repository GitHub Pages, the site should be working properly.

## Command line deployment

You can also use [push-dir package](https://github.com/L33T-KR3W/push-dir):

First install it via npm:

```bash
npm install push-dir --save-dev
```

Add a `deploy` command to your `package.json` with the branch as `gh-pages` for project repository OR `master` for user or organization site.

```js
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt",
  "generate": "nuxt generate",
  "start": "nuxt start",
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup"
},
```

Then generate and deploy your static application:

```bash
npm run generate
npm run deploy
```

## Build server deployment

You can take deployment one step further and rather than having to manually compile and deploy the files from your local install, you can make use of a build server to monitor your GitHub repository for new commits and then checkout, compile and deploy everything for you automatically.

Before you configure the build server, you'll first need to [generate a GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/#creating-a-token) in order to grant the build server permission to perform tasks on your behalf. Once you have created your token, keep a copy of it safe ready to use a little later on.

### GitHub Actions

To deploy via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), the official tool for software automation with GitHub, if you don't have a workflow you need to create a new one or append a new step to your existing workflow.

It uses the [GitHub Pages Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) which pushes the generated files from the `dist` folder to your default GitHub Pages branch `gh-pages`.

With an existing workflow, add the following step:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist
```

With a new workflow, paste the following content into a new file called `cd.yml` in `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: cd

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cd:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node: [14]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Setup node env
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Generate
        run: yarn run generate

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

Then commit this to your repository:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/cd.yml
git commit -m "Adding github pages deploy workflow"
git push origin
```

On completion, you'll see your `gh-pages` branch updated as well as your site.

### Travis CI

To deploy with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), a free for open source projects build server, sign in via your GitHub account, granting Travis access to view your repositories, and then enable the build server for your repository by toggling the switch next to your repositories name in the list displayed.

![Travis Builder Server Enable](/github_pages_travis_01.png)

Next, click the cog icon beside your repository name to configure the general settings of the build sever and enable the 'Build only if .travis.yml is present' feature by toggling the switch.

![Travis Builder Server Settings](/github_pages_travis_02.png)

On the same screen, scroll down to the Environment Variables section and create a new variables named `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and in the value field paste a copy of the GitHub personal access token your created earlier and click the 'Add' button.

![Travis Builder Server Environment Variables](/github_pages_travis_03.png)

Finally, create a `.travis.yml` configuration file in the root of your repository with the following contents

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - '12'

cache:
  directories:
    - 'node_modules'

branches:
  only:
    - master

install:
  - npm install
  - npm run generate

script:
  - echo "Skipping tests"

deploy:
  provider: pages
  skip-cleanup: true
  github-token: $GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN # Set in travis-ci.org dashboard, marked secure https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/#Setting-the-GitHub-token
  target-branch: gh-pages
  local-dir: dist
  on:
    branch: master
```

and then commit this to your repository

```bash
git add .travis.yml
git commit -m "Adding travis deploy configuration"
git push origin
```

Now, whenever you commit any changes to your repository, from within Travis, you'll see a new build start up

![Travis Builder Server Output](/github_pages_travis_04.png)

and on completion, you'll see your GitHub pages site automatically updated.

### Appveyor

To deploy via [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com), another free for open source projects build server, sign up for a new account choosing the GitHub authentication option to sign in using your GitHub account.

Once signed in, click the 'New project' link and then click the 'Add' button beside your repository name in the list displayed to enable the build server on your repository.

![Appveyor Builder Server Enable](/github_pages_appveyor_01.png)

Next, in the root of your repository, create an `appveyor.yml` configuration file with the following contents

```yaml
environment:
  # Nuxt requires node v12 minimum
  nodejs_version: '12'
  # Encrypt sensitive data (https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt)
  github_access_token:
    secure: ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
  github_email:
    secure: ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_EMAIL

# Only run on master branch
branches:
  only:
    - master

# Install scripts. (runs after repo cloning)
install:
  # switch nodejs version
  - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version
  # install modules
  - npm install
  # generate static files
  - npm run generate
  # configure global git credentials store (https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/git-push/)
  - git config --global credential.helper store
  - ps: Add-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.git-credentials" "https://$($env:github_access_token):x-oauth-basic@github.com`n"
  - git config --global user.email $env:github_email
  # deploy to GitHub pages
  - npm run deploy

# No tests to run
test: off

# Don't actually build.
build: off
```

**_NB_** This configuration assumes you've configured your `package.json` file as per the [Command line deployment](#command-line-deployment) instructions

Before you commit this file however, you'll need to change the `ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_EMAIL` variables with your GitHub personal access token from earlier and your GitHub email address, encrypted using the [Appveyor encryption tool](https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt).

Once updated, commit the file to your repository

```bash
git add appveyor.yml
git commit -m "Adding appveyor deploy configuration"
git push origin
```

Now, whenever you commit any changes to your repository, from within Appveyor, you'll see a new build start up

![Appveyor Builder Server Output](/github_pages_appveyor_02.png)

and on completion, you'll see your GitHub pages site automatically updated.
