## Introduction

With Nuxt.js version 2.13, the [full-static mode](/blog/going-full-static/) has been introduced. In addition, a new command `nuxt export` was added to pre-render your pages without triggering a webpack build with the goal to separate the rendering and build process. The only issue was that most Nuxt.js users weren't able to unleash the full potential of the separation... **until now.**

## Faster Static Deployments

With v2.14, `nuxt generate` will **automagically skip webpack build step when no code has been changed** and use the previous build using cache. This will help to drastically improve static deployments time by avoiding unnecessary builds which is usually the most time-consuming part of generation process. Cache support is **platform-agnostic** and works on Netlify, Vercel, or any other CI/CD setup that is caching `node_modules`.

## Generate time: cache vs full webpack build

See the comparison in seconds between two `nuxt generate`:

- `Build` is when a webpack build is required
- `Cache` is only when the content has changed (webpack build skipped)

The static site generation of our projects on content changes are now **~3.6x times** faster 🚀

## Using in your projects

1. Update `nuxt` to the latest minor version, which is v2.14.

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn upgrade nuxt
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

```bash
npm update
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

2. Ensure `target` is `static` inside your `nuxt.config`

```js{}[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  target: 'static'
  // ...
}
```

`nuxt generate` will behave as before to avoid breaking changes and provide legacy compatibility if you keep `target: ‘server’` or don't specify target.

3. That’s it 🙌

Now, the `nuxt generate` command will build the project only if necessary, which is the case when files inside the project have been changed. It will always re-render your routes to static HTML files, like `nuxt export` is doing already.

Now you only have to change your build command back from `nuxt build && nuxt export` to `nuxt generate` on the platform you are using. If you are using a CI, ensure that you are properly caching `node_modules`.

### Excluding Files from Cache

By default, nuxt ignores these directories so if any change happens inside them, build will not be triggered:

- Build directory (`.nuxt/`)
- Static directory (`static/`)
- Generate dist (`dist/`)
- `node_modules`
- `README.md`
- Hidden dotfiles (like `.npmrc`)

You can add more patterns using [generate.cache.ignore](/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate#cache) option in `nuxt.config`:

```js{}[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  generate: {
    cache: {
      ignore: [
        // When something changed in the docs folder, do not re-build via webpack
        'docs'
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to use a function for `ignore` option to override default ignore entries.

### Module Authors

What if you are developing a nuxt module that is working with files that should not trigger a rebuild? The best example is for [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org) module that reads markdown files from the repository. In this case, these files are used within a runtime module, which is the case when using `@nuxt/content`, the module itself can tell nuxt to ignore these files for you already so you don't have to do anything! Module authors can use the new `generate:cache:ignore` hook to do so:

```js
nuxt.hook('generate:cache:ignore', ignore => ignore.push('content'))
```

## How it works

When using the new `nuxt generate` with `static` target, a snapshot including checksum of non-ignored project files as well as nuxt version and some other configuration will be written `.nuxt/build.json`. In addition, we also move the build directory to `node_modules/.cache/nuxt`. Because `node_modules` is cached by all major platforms (Netlify, Vercel, ...) and common CI/CD scripts, this solution works out of the box without additional configuration.

When `nuxt generate` is called subsequently, it will again create a checksum based on your project files and then compare it to the existing one inside `node_modules/.cache/nuxt/build.json`.

If they match, it means that nothing is changed that needs rebuild so we can directly start rendering pages.

If a mismatch is detected, it means that a full rebuild would be necessary. You can also see what file caused rebuild by checking console logs. After the build, nuxt generate will save the new checksum inside `.nuxt/build.json`. You can check full implementation [here](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/7712).

### Back to old school commands

With Nuxt v2.13, we introduced `nuxt export` and `nuxt serve` specially designed for the static target. With Nuxt v2.14, they are deprecated as `nuxt generate` and `nuxt start` is smart to detect the target and build when necessary.

Server target:

- `nuxt dev` = development server
- `nuxt build` = build your application for production
- `nuxt start` = start the production server (use it for Node.js hosting like Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc)

Static target:

- `nuxt dev` = development server
- `nuxt generate` = build if needed and statically export to `dist/`
- `nuxt start` = serve the `dist/` directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying

## What to do next

- Upgrade your project to [nuxt@2.14.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.14.0)
- Use `nuxt generate` instead of `nuxt export`
- Use `nuxt start` instead of `nuxt serve`
- Enjoy fast deployments 🤙
