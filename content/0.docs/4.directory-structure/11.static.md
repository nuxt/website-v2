`/static/robots.txt` will be available at `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`

`/static/favicon.ico` will be available at  `http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico`

This option is helpful for files like `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` or `CNAME` (which is important for GitHub Pages deployment).

This directory cannot be renamed without extra configuration.

## Static Assets

If you don't want to use Webpack assets from the `assets` directory, you can add the images to the static directory.

In your code, you can then reference these files relative to the root (`/`):

```html
<!-- Static image from static directory -->
<img src="/my-image.png" />

<!-- webpacked image from assets directory -->
<img src="~/assets/my-image-2.png" />
```

::alert{type="info"}
Nuxt doesn't change this path, so if you customize your `router.base` then you'll need to make sure to add that manually to your paths. For example:

```html
<img :src="`${yourPrefix}/my-image.png`" />
```
::

## Static Directory Config

Should you need to you can configure the `static/` directory behavior in the `nuxt.config.js` file.

### Static asset Prefix

If you deploy Nuxt.js to a subfolder, e.g. `/blog/`, the router base will be added to the static asset path by default. If you want to disable this behavior, you can set `static.prefix` to false in the `nuxt.config.js`.

```js
export default {
  static: {
    prefix: false
  }
}
```

Default: `/blog/my-image.png`

With `static.prefix` disabled: `/my-image.png`
