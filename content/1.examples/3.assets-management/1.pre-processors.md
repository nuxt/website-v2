In this example:

`pages/index.vue` uses pug as a template language and sass for styling.

`nuxt.config.js`:

- registers the style resources module.
- contains a `styleResources` property to add `assets/variables.scss`.
- contains a `css property` to add `assets/main.scss`.

`package.json` shows the dependencies needed.
