title: Router Middleware
description: Using router middleware to set a class to the body so we can then style differently depending on the route
category: middleware
---

In this example:

`store/class.js` sets a class to the body.

`middleware/class.js` uses router middleware to set a class before we enter the route.

`components/Navigation.vue` changes the font size for the route with the name of `router-middleware`.

`nuxt.config.js` contains the `router` property to activate the middleware.
