title: Anonymous Middleware
description: Using anonymous middleware to show the analytics of how many times a user visits a page.
category: middleware

In this example:

`pages/anonymous-middleware.vue` contains a middleware function which uses the store to call the increment mutation with results from the store displayed on the page.

`store/analytics.js` sets the `pageVisits` to 0 and increments the visits every time the increment function is called.
