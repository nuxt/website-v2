description: In this example we show how to use a plugin so that it is only available on the client side
category: plugins

In this example:

`plugins/client-only.client.js` uses the `window.alert()` function which is not available on server side.

`nuxt.config.js` contains the `plugins` property which registers the plugin on the client side by adding the `.client` extension.

::alert{type="next"}
