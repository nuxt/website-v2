# Nested Pages

How to use the Nuxt Child component to create parent and child pages.

---

In this example:

`pages/parent.vue` contains the `<NuxtChild>` component. Everything on this page will be seen on both the parent and child pages.

`pages/parent/index.vue` contains text that will be replaced when the child links are clicked.

`pages/parent/child.vue` and `pages/parent/child2.vue` will be rendered as parent/child and parent/child2.
