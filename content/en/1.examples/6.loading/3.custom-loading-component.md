# Custom Loading Component

Create a custom loading component, modify the default loader as well as the spinner for spas

---

In this example:

`components/LoadingBar.vue` shows a custom loading spinner to use instead of the default loading bar.

`nuxt.config.js` contains the `loading` property which imports the loading component

`pages/loading.vue` programmatically starts the loader so we force the page to take 2 seconds to load

::alert{type="next"}
