# Lazy Loading Components

Use fetch in your components to fetch data from an API as well as auto importing and lazy loading components

---

In this example:

`components/MountainsList.vue` uses fetch to fetch data from an API and uses:

- `$fetchState.pending` to show a loading message when waiting for the data to load.
- `$fetchState.error` to show an error message if the component does not load.

`pages/index.vue` shows how to lazy load a component by prefixing it with the word "Lazy".

`nuxt.config.js` shows `components: true` for auto importing components.
