# Deploy Nuxt with Vercel

Learn how to deploy a Nuxt app to Vercel that supports both static and server-rendered pages.

---

To get started with Nuxt 3 on [Vercel](http://vercel.com), you can clone an example using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
$ npm i -g vercel
$ vercel init nuxtjs
Vercel CLI
> Success! Initialized "nuxtjs" example in ~/your-folder.
- To deploy, `cd nuxtjs` and run `vercel`.
```

## Static site with Vercel

If you would like to deploy a static site on Vercel, **no configuration is necessary**. Vercel will detect that you are using Nuxt and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.

## SSR with Vercel

If you would like to server-render pages on Vercel, **no configuration is necessary for Nuxt 3 applications**. Vercel will detect that you are using Nuxt and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.

To server-render pages with Nuxt v2, create a `vercel.json` file at the root of your project as follows:

```jsx
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "nuxt.config.js",
      "use": "@nuxtjs/vercel-builder"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Service Worker with Nuxt PWA Module

To avoid 404 for Service Workers, make sure to include `sw` to your routes settings.

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "nuxt.config.js",
      "use": "@nuxtjs/vercel-builder",
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/sw.js",
      "continue": true,
      "headers": {
        "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate",
        "Service-Worker-Allowed": "/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
