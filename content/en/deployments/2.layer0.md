How to deploy Nuxt app on Layer0?

---

Layer0 supports universal (SSR) Nuxt applications.

[Layer0](https://www.layer0.co) is an all-in-one platform to develop, deploy, preview, experiment on, monitor, and run your headless frontend. It is focused on large, dynamic websites and best-in-class performance through EdgeJS (a JavaScript-based Content Delivery Network), predictive prefetching, and performance monitoring. Layer0 offers a free tier.

For detailed instructions consult the [Layer0 Nuxt documentation](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/nuxt).

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a free account on [Layer0's signup page](https://app.layer0.co/signup).

2. Install the [Layer0 CLI](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/cli)



::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn global add @layer0/cli
```
```bash [NPM]
npm i -g @layer0/cli
```
::



## Configure your project

3. Make sure [server side rendering is enabled](/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-ssr) and in your `nuxt.config.js` add the `@layer0/nuxt` module:

```js
// nuxt.config.js

module.exports = {
  modules: ['@layer0/nuxt/module']
}
```

4. Run `layer0 init` which will configure your project for Layer0.

## Running and deploying your project

5. To test your app locally, run the following in your project directory:

```js
layer0 run
```

6. To deploy your app, run the following in your project directory:

```js
layer0 deploy
```

## Optimize your project's performance

- (Optional) To optimize the performance of server side rendering in Nuxt, Layer0 recommends moving most your modules into `buildModules` as described in the [modules vs buildModules section](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/nuxt#section_modules_vs_buildmodules) of the Layer0 Nuxt guide.
- (Optional) Layer0 automatically supports Nuxt's built-in routing scheme. However you can and should optimize the performance by customizing the routing, caching, and prefetching via EdgeJS as shown in the [Routing section](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/nuxt#section_routing) of the Layer0 Nuxt guide.
