How to deploy Nuxt on Kinsta Application Hosting?

---

[Kinsta Application Hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting) is a service that lets you build and deploy your web apps directly from your Git repository.

## SSR - configuration
**Kinsta Application Hosting** is using Buildpacks to determine what is needed to build and deploy the application.

Whenever a deployment is initiated the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.

This means, that your `package.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "start": "nuxt start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "nuxt": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```
There is also a [Starter](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-nuxt), if you want to give it a spin.
