# Directory Structure

The default Nuxt application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both small and large applications. You are free to organize your application however you like and can create other directories as and when you need them.

---

Let's create the directories and files that do not exist in our project yet.

```bash
mkdir components assets static
touch nuxt.config.js
```

These are the main directories and files that we use when building a Nuxt application. You will find an explanation of each of them below.

::alert{type="info"}
Creating directories with these names enables features in your Nuxt project.
::

## Directories

### The pages directory

The `pages` directory contains your application's views and routes. As you've learned in the last chapter, Nuxt reads all the `.vue` files inside this directory and uses them to create the application router.

::

### The components directory

The `components` directory is where you put all your Vue.js components which are then imported into your pages.

With Nuxt you can create your components and auto import them into your .vue files meaning there is no need to manually import them in the script section. Nuxt will scan and auto import these for you once you have components set to true.

### The assets directory

The `assets` directory contains your uncompiled assets such as your styles, images, or fonts.

::

### The static directory

The `static` directory is directly mapped to the server root and contains files that have to keep their names (e.g. `robots.txt`) _or_ likely won't change (e.g. the favicon)

### The nuxt.config.js file

The `nuxt.config.js` file is the single point of configuration for Nuxt. If you want to add modules or override default settings, this is the place to apply the changes.

### The package.json file

The `package.json` file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your application.

## More about the project structures

There are more helpful directories and files, including [content](/docs/directory-structure/content), [layouts](/docs/directory-structure/layouts), [middleware](/docs/directory-structure/middleware), [modules](/docs/directory-structure/modules), [plugins](/docs/directory-structure/plugins) and [store](/docs/directory-structure/store) . As they aren't necessary for small applications, they are not covered here.
