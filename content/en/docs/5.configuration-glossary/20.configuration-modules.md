# The modules property

Modules are Nuxt extensions which can extend its core functionality and add endless integrations. [Learn More](/docs/directory-structure/modules)

---

- Type: `Array`

Example (`nuxt.config.js`):

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    // Using package name
    '@nuxtjs/axios',

    // Relative to your project srcDir
    '~/modules/awesome.js',

    // Providing options
    ['@nuxtjs/google-analytics', { ua: 'X1234567' }],

    // Inline definition
    function () {}
  ]
}
```

Module developers usually provide additionally needed steps and details for usage.

Nuxt tries to resolve each item in the modules array using node require path (in the `node_modules`) and then will be resolved from project `srcDir` if `~` alias is used. Modules are executed sequentially so the order is important.

**Note:** Any plugins injected by modules are added to the *beginning* of the plugins list. Your options are to:
- Manually add your plugin to the end of the list of plugins (`this.nuxt.options.plugins.push(...`)
- Reverse the order of the modules if it depends on another

Modules should export a function to enhance nuxt build/runtime and optionally return a promise until their job is finished. Note that they are required at runtime so should be already transpiled if depending on modern ES6 features.

Please see [Modules Guide](/docs/directory-structure/modules) for more detailed information on how they work or if interested developing your own module. Also we have provided an official [Modules](https://github.com/nuxt-community/awesome-nuxt#modules) Section listing dozens of production ready modules made by Nuxt Community.

## `buildModules`

::alert{type="info"}
This feature is available since Nuxt v2.9
::

Some modules are only required during development and build time. Using `buildModules` helps to make production startup faster and also significantly decreasing `node_modules` size for production deployments. Please refer to each module docs to see if it is recommended to use `modules` or `buildModules`.

The usage difference is:

- Instead of adding to `modules` inside `nuxt.config.js`, use `buildModules`
- Instead of adding to `dependencies` inside `package.json`, use `devDependencies` (`yarn add --dev` or `npm install --save-dev`)
