# The watchParam property

Watch param change and execute component methods on change (asyncData, fetch(context))

---

- **Type:** `Boolean` (default: `undefined`)

Use the `watchParam` key to set up a watcher for route params. If the params change, asyncData and fetch(context) will be called. Watching is enabled by default.

If you want to disable watching for params, set `watchParam: false`.

```js
export default {
  watchParam: false
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
By default `nuxt.js` reset _page_ component `data` state after route param change, you can use `watchParam: false` to disable this behaviour.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Warning**: The new `fetch` hook introduced in 2.12 is not affected by `watchParam`. For more information see [listening to query string changes](/docs/features/data-fetching#the-fetch-hook) for params is the same.
