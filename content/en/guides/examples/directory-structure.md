Basic project with pages, components, assets and static directory as well as the nuxt.config and package.json files.

- The assets folder contains an svg and a css file.
- The components folder contains a navigation component.
- The pages folder contains pages at root level as well as inside a folder.
- The static folder contains a favicon.
- The nuxt config has components set to true for activating components so that you can use components without having to write import statements as well as how to add the css file globally to your application.
