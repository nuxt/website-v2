description: "NuxtJS solves front-end development issues, using Vue.js, Node.js and a suite of other open source tools such as Vite, Webpack, Babel and PostCSS.
If you use NuxtJS in your daily work and feel that it has made your life easier, please consider backing us.
If you run a business and is using NuxtJS in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor NuxtJS development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the community and makes it easier to attract NuxtJS developers.
