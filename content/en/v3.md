    :headline[Nitro Engine]

    We worked for 9 months on Nuxt's new server engine for Nuxt: **Nitro**. It unlocks new **full-stack capabilities** to Nuxt server and beyond.

    In development, it uses rollup and node workers to give Hot Module Replacement for your server code and context isolation. It also **generates your server API** by reading files in `server/api/` and **server functions** from `server/functions/`.

    In production, it builds your app and server into one universal `.output` directory. This **output is light**: minified and removed from any node modules (except polyfills). You can deploy this output on any system supporting JavaScript, from Node, Serverless, Workers, Edge-side rendering or purely static.

    The output is combined with both runtime code to run your Nuxt server in any environment (including browser Service Workers, experimental) and serve you static files, making it a **true hybrid framework** for the JAMStack. In addition, a native storage layer is implemented, supporting multi source, drivers and local assets.

    The foundation of the Nitro server is [h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3): a minimal http framework built for high performance and portability.

  :headline[Nuxt Bridge]

We moved to Vue 3 and re-wrote Nuxt after 4 years of development to make it a strong foundation for the future.

### Smooth upgrade to Nuxt3

We've worked to make the upgrade as easy as possible between Nuxt2 and Nuxt3.

- Legacy plugins and modules working
- Nuxt2 config compatible
- Partial pages options API

### Bringing Nuxt3 experience to your existing Nuxt2 project

As we've been working on new features for Nuxt3, we've back-ported some of them to Nuxt2.

- Using Nitro with Nuxt2
- Using Composition API with Nuxt2
- Using new CLI and Devtools with Nuxt2
- Progressively upgrade to Nuxt3
- Compatibility with Nuxt2 module ecosystem
- Upgrade piece by piece (Nitro, Composition API, Nuxt Kit)
