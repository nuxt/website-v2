How to deploy a Nuxt app with Edgio?

---

Edgio supports both static and universal (SSR) Nuxt applications.

[Edgio Applications](https://docs.edg.io) is an Internet-scale platform that makes it easy for teams to build, release, protect, and accelerate their web apps and APIs.

For detailed instructions consult the [Edgio's Nuxt Integration Guide](https://docs.edg.io/guides/nuxt)

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a [free account](https://app.layer0.co/signup) on Edgio

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn global add @edgio/cli
```
```bash [NPM]
npm i -g @edgio/cli
```
::

3. Update `nuxt.config.*` to include `@edgio/nuxt/module` in `buildModules`:

```js
buildModules: [['@edgio/nuxt/module', { edgioSourceMaps: true }]],
```
