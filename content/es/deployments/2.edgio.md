How to deploy a Nuxt app with Edgio?

---

Edgio supports both static and universal (SSR) Nuxt applications.

[Edgio Applications](https://docs.edg.io) is an Internet-scale platform that makes it easy for teams to build, release, protect, and accelerate their web apps and APIs.

For detailed instructions consult [Edgio's Nuxt Integration Guide](https://docs.edg.io/guides/nuxt)

```bash [Yarn]
yarn global add @edgio/cli
```
```bash [NPM]
