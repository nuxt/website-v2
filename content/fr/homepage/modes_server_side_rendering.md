The most popular mode for Nuxt. With SSR, also called "universal" or "isomorphic" mode, a Node.js server
will be used to deliver HTML based on your Vue components to the client instead of the pure javascript.
Using SSR will lead to a large SEO boost, better UX and more opportunities (compared to a traditional Vue SPA).<br><br>
Because implementing SSR on your own can be really tedious, Nuxt.js gives you full support out of the box
and will take care of common pitfalls.
