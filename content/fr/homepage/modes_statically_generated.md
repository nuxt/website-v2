Static Site Generation is a very hot topic right now (aka JAMStack). Instead of switching to another framework and
spending time to get used to it, why not killing two birds with one stone?

Nuxt.js supports generating a static website based on your Vue application. It is the "best of both worlds"
as you don't need a server but still have SEO benefits because Nuxt will pre-render all pages and include
the necessary HTML. Also, you can deploy the resulting page easily to Netlify or GitHub pages.
