# Components directory

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components. Components are what makes up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

The `components` directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused throughout your pages, layouts and even other components.

## Components Discovery

![](/img/docs/components.png)

Starting from `v2.13`, Nuxt can auto-import the components you use. To activate this feature, set `components: true` in your configuration:

```js{}[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  components: true
}
```

Any components in the `~/components` directory can then be used throughout your pages, layouts (and other components) without needing to explicitly import them.

```bash
| components/
--| TheHeader.vue
--| TheFooter.vue
```

```html{}[layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <TheHeader />
    <Nuxt />
    <TheFooter />
  </div>
</template>
```
