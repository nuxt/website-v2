# fetch Hook

In this example we use the fetch hook to fetch data from components and from pages

---

In this example:

`pages/index.vue` imports `components/Mountains.vue` which uses the `fetch` hook and the `$http` module to fetch our data at component level while `pages/mountains/_slug` fetches the data at page level and include:

- `$fetchState.pending` to show a loading text when the data is loading.
- `$fetchState.error` to show an error message when we can't retrieve the data.
- `$fetch` to fetch the data again when clicked.
