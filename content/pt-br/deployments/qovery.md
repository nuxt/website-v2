How to deploy Nuxt on Qovery?

---

[Qovery](https://qovery.com) is a fully-managed cloud platform that runs on your AWS and Scaleway account where you can host static and dynamic sites, backend APIs, databases, cron jobs, and all your other apps in one place.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have a Nuxt project to deploy. If you need a project, follow the [Get Started](/docs/get-started/installation) guide.

## Setup

Follow the procedure below to set up Nuxt on Qovery:

### 1. Create a Qovery account.

Visit the [Qovery dashboard](https://console.qovery.com) to create an account if you don't already have one.

### 2. Create a cluster, project, environment and services

Have a look at [this tutorial](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/getting-started/deploy-your-first-application/) on the official page.

## Deploy

Your app should be deployed. You can see the status in real time by clicking on deployment logs.

## Continuous deploys

Now that Qovery is connected to your repo, it will **automatically build and publish your site** any time you push to git.

## Custom domains

Add your own domains to your site easily using Qovery's [custom domains](https://docs.qovery.com/guides/getting-started/setting-custom-domain/) guide.

## Support

Chat with Qovery developers on [Discord](https://discord.qovery.com) if you need help.
