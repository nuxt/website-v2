Monograms

#description
Our logo is made from two elements: the triangular mountains and the wordmark. In most cases, they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.

Our colours have been carefully considered to work in harmony and consistency across various media. When creating Nuxt communications, use the colour values shown on the following pages to make sure your designs stay on-brand.

Typography

#description
Our brand typeface is DM Sans by Colophon Foundry for Google. This open-source typeface was chosen for its
combination of smoothness and structure. Its geometric shapes and soft transitions will bring clarity and openness
to our texts. Also, itâ€™s open availability will let other members of the Nuxt community incorporate it into
their work.
