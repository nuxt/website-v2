# Nuxt build directory

The `.nuxt` directory is the so-called _build directory_. It is dynamically generated and hidden by default. Inside the directory you can find automatically generated files when using `nuxt dev` or your build artifacts when using `nuxt build`. Modifying these files is great for debugging but remember that they are generated files and once you run the `dev` or `build` command again, anything that was saved here will be regenerated.

::alert{type="warning"}
The `.nuxt` directory should not be committed to your version control system and should be ignored through your `.gitignore` as it will be generated automatically when executing `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`.

### The buildDir Property

By default, many tools assume that `.nuxt` is a hidden directory, because its name starts with a dot. You can use the buildDir option to prevent that. If you do change the name remember to add the new name to your `.gitignore` file.

```js{}[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  buildDir: 'nuxt-dist'
}
```

### Inside the .nuxt folder:

- The router.js file is the generated router file that Nuxt generates for you when you put `.vue` files inside the pages folder. You can use this file for debugging for when you want to look up which routes are generated for vue-router and find out the names of a specific route.
- The router.scrollBehavior.js which is your Router ScrollBehavior
- The Components folder has all your Nuxt components such as NuxtChild and NuxtLink. It also contains the nuxt-build-indicator which is the page we see when your application is building and nuxt-loading which is your loading component that gets seen when we are waiting for your page to load. You will also find the nuxt-error page in here which contains the Nuxt default error page.
- The mixins folder has the files needed for the Nuxt `$fetch` method.
- The views folder contains your app template and your server error page.
- The app.js is your main application file.
- The client.js file is your client file needed for everything that happens client side.
- The empty file is intentionally left empty for no-op aliases
- The index.js file bootstraps your application.
- The loading.html is the file that is used when the page is loading.
- The middleware file is where your middleware is kept
- The server.js file is all the code that is ran on the server
- the utilities contains the utilities that Nuxt needs for it to work.

### Deploying

The `.nuxt` folder is part of the files needed to deploy your SSR application. It is not needed for deploying your static Nuxt app though because we use the `dist` folder for that.
