# Named Middleware

Using named middleware to authenticate a user using the store and allow them to visit a page once authenticated

---

In this example:

`pages/named-middleware.vue` contains a `middleware` property with the value of `auth` which is called before a user enters the route.

`middleware/auth.js` checks to see if the user is authenticated and if they aren't it redirects them to the auth page.

`pages/auth.vue` uses the store to authenticate the user.

`store/auth.js` sets the user and password values and redirects the user.
