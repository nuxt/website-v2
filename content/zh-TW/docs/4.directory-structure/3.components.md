# Components directory

The `components` directory contains your Vue.js Components. Components are what makes up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

### Fetching Data

To access asynchronous data from an API in your components you can use Nuxt [`fetch()`](/docs/features/data-fetching#the-fetch-method).

By checking `$fetchState.pending`, we can show a message when data is waiting to be loaded. We can also check `$fetchState.error` and show an error message if there is an error fetching the data. When using `fetch()`, we must declare the appropriate properties in `data()`. The data that comes from the fetch can then be assigned to these properties.

```html{}[components/MountainsList.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <p v-if="$fetchState.pending">Loading....</p>
    <p v-else-if="$fetchState.error">Error while fetching mountains</p>
    <ul v-else>
      <li v-for="(mountain, index) in mountains" :key="index">
        {{ mountain.title }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        mountains: []
      }
    },
    async fetch() {
      this.mountains = await fetch(
        'https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains'
      ).then(res => res.json())
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Components Discovery

:prose-img{src="/img/docs/components.png"}

Starting from `v2.13`, Nuxt can auto-import the components you use. To activate this feature, set `components: true` in your configuration:

```js{}[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  components: true
}
```

Any components in the `~/components` directory can then be used throughout your pages, layouts (and other components) without needing to explicitly import them.

```bash
| components/
--| TheHeader.vue
--| TheFooter.vue
```

```html{}[layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <TheHeader />
    <Nuxt />
    <TheFooter />
  </div>
</template>
```

### Dynamic Imports

To dynamically import a component, also known as lazy loading a component, all you need to do is add the `Lazy` prefix in your templates.

```html{}[layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <TheHeader />
    <Nuxt />
    <LazyTheFooter />
  </div>
</template>
```

Using the lazy prefix you can also dynamically import a component when an event is triggered.

```html{}[pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Mountains</h1>
    <LazyMountainsList v-if="show" />
    <button v-if="!show" @click="show = true">Show List</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      show: false
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Nested Directories

If you have components in nested directories such as:

```bash
components/
  base/
      foo/
         CustomButton.vue
```

The component name will be based on its own path directory and filename. Therefore, the component will be:

```html
<BaseFooCustomButton />
```

If we want to use it as `<CustomButton />` while keeping the directory structure, we can add the directory of `CustomButton.vue` into `nuxt.config.js`.

```bash{}[nuxt.config.js]
components: {
  dirs: [
    '~/components',
    '~/components/base/foo'
  ]
}
```

And now we can use `<CustomButton />` instead of `<BaseFooCustomButton />`.

```html{}[pages/index.vue]
<CustomButton />
```
