# The rootDir property

Define the workspace of Nuxt application

---

- Type: `String`
- Default: `process.cwd()`

This property will be overwritten by the nuxt commands(nuxt start, nuxt build etc) if an argument is passed to them. Eg running `nuxt ./my-app/` will set the `rootDir` to the absolute path of `./my-app/` from the current/working directory.

Because of that its normally not needed to configure this option unless you will use [Nuxt programmatically](/docs/internals-glossary/nuxt).

::alert{type="info"}
Both `rootDir` as the package root containing the `node_modules` directory need to be within the same directory tree to be able to <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together">resolve dependencies</a>. See the [`srcDir` option](/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-srcdir) for examples of directory structure when that is not the case.
